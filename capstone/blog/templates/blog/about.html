			<h2>Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles</h2>
			<p>Please, Don-Bot&hellip; look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! No, she'll probably make me do it. I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?</p>
			<h2>The Why of Fry</h2>
			<p>Can I use the gun? Fatal. Bender?! You stole the atom. Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?</p>
